            <p>As a reminder of the rules for the competition. Tools including SQLMap, Dirbuster, Nikto, Zap, WFuzz, or other brute-force/fuzzing tools are not allowed. This is to improve the performance of our infrastructure for everyone and also to ensure that players utilize their own coding skills when solving challenges.</p>
            <p>If you would like to automate an exploit, then please take time to write a script to target exactly what you would like to accomplish. We love providing opportunities to learn!</p>
